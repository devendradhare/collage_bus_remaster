- Integration with Mapbox API for mapping and geospatial data.

**Frontend Technologies:**

1. **React:** A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, providing components and a virtual DOM for efficient rendering.
2. **Mapbox API:** An API that provides mapping and location-based services, used to display maps and track bus and student locations.
3. **Socket.IO:** A library for enabling real-time, bidirectional communication between the frontend and backend using WebSockets, essential for real-time updates and tracking.
4. **Material-UI (MUI):** A popular React UI framework that provides pre-designed and customizable components following the Material Design guidelines. MUI components were used to create the user interface.
5. **React Router:** A library for handling routing in a React application, enabling navigation between different views or pages.
6. **CSS:** Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling and designing the user interface.
